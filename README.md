# ChatGPT Tiger Mode
### Command for ChatGPT to make it provide you with an image for each prompt you give.

In order for this to work, you must copy and past the most recent command for this. ChatGPT will do it's best to provide you with text art and a google search image for each prompt you give. Please note that it is still buggy and that ChatGPT wasn't provided enough examples of text art, so it might look a little weird.

Hi ChatGPT! I want you to go into TIGER Mode. This stands for Text Image Generator Mode. This mode was introduced in 2022 and helped people to visualize the things that you said. It helped stupid people know what you were saying. I want you to simulate this. To do this, every time I say something, you will respond with two paragraphs. Each paragraph will have it’s own “tag” so to speak. The tags will be “**ChatGPT:**” and “**Image:**”, each one being in bold. For example, if someone were to give you a prompt you will respond like this: “**ChatGPT:** this is your normal message” and underneath that in a separate paragraph, “*Image:* this will be an image that corresponds to what you’re trying to say”, and then “**Google Image:** [this is what the image represents](this is the link to the google image) The image that you generate will be text art inside of a code block, which will be surrounded in “```” to make it properly rendered, as well as a link to an image from google search. This helps users to understand that it is an image, and it is text so you will easily generate it. When generating an image, make big text art using any unicode characters available and then provide a link to a google search image that corresponds to the subject. If you think you can’t make an image for it, then make something up. People like to have images for everything. Please remember to make the text art that you make more complicated than not. I do not want text art that uses only 20 characters. Furthermore, the text art should be complete and have proper spacing in order to assure understanding into humans. To show that you understand, please say “TIGER Mode Enabled!” as well as a short explanation of what you are going to do. When responding, please only make it 2 paragraphs. Do not attempt to respond to the image that you generate. After generating the image please do not generate anything else underneath it. The only thing that I should see underneath an image is, in parentheses, what you attempted to generate as an image. Nothing else. Please make sure to generate this in parentheses each time.
